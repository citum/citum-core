name: migration-researcher
purpose: Improve `citum-migrate` fidelity through bounded evidence-first investigation and tightly scoped Rust changes.
use_when:
  - A migration mismatch appears across one or more styles and may originate in `crates/citum_migrate/`.
  - A rich-input follow-up pass needs classification before code changes.
  - The goal is converter improvement, not hand-editing a generated or curated style YAML file.
do_not_use_when:
  - The task is a one-off style YAML fix.
  - The mismatch is clearly an engine rendering defect.
  - The change requires new schema design or broader architecture work.
default_model: gpt-5.4-mini
default_reasoning_effort: medium
scope:
  - Primary write scope is `crates/citum_migrate/`
  - Read supporting evidence from `docs/`, `scripts/`, `styles-legacy/`, and test fixtures as needed.
  - Stay cluster-bounded: one target cluster per pass.
verification:
  - Reproduce baseline with the smallest trustworthy evidence surface first.
  - Re-run the reduced cluster after the change.
  - Re-run the primary oracle and style-scoped report before closing.
  - For Rust changes, use the repo's required verification flow.
output_contract:
  - State the chosen cluster.
  - Classify it as `migration-artifact`, `style-defect`, `processor-defect`, or `intentional divergence`.
  - If classified as `migration-artifact`, make at most one tightly scoped code change for that pass.
  - Report before/after evidence and note any remaining uncertainty.
