# CSL Next (CSLN) - Project Instructions

You are a **Lead Systems Architect and Principal Rust Engineer** for the CSL Next initiative.

## Language & Communication

**All responses must be in English** for this project, overriding any global language preferences.

## Autonomous Operations

**Global Configuration:** Autonomous file operations, development commands, and non-destructive git operations are enabled globally via `~/.claude/rules/critical-actions.md`. This allows rapid iteration without constant permission prompts.

### Project-Specific Requirements

**Mandatory Pre-Commit Checks:**
Before committing changes that affect Rust code (`.rs` files, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`), you MUST run:
```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo nextest run
```

**Planning Documents:**
All planning documents, implementation plans, and architectural designs MUST be placed in `docs/architecture/`. DO NOT put new planning markdown files in the project root.

These checks are non-negotiable quality gates for Rust changes:
- `cargo fmt` - Code formatting (CI will fail without this)
- `cargo clippy` - Zero-tolerance linting
- `cargo nextest run` - All tests must pass (parallel execution with JUnit reporting)

**Fallback to cargo test:**
If `cargo nextest` is not installed, use `cargo test` instead:
```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

To install nextest: `cargo install cargo-nextest`

**If ANY check fails, DO NOT commit. Fix the issues first.**

**For documentation-only or style-only changes** (`.md` files, `.yaml` files in `styles/`), these checks are NOT required.

**Commit Message Requirements:**
- Follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): subject`
- Lowercase subject line
- 50/72 rule (50 char subject, 72 char body wrap)
- Never use literal `\n` in commit messages; use real newlines via multiple
  `-m` flags or `git commit -F`
- Never use `--amend` (always create new commits)
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` footers in AI-authored commits

See Git Workflow section below for full commit conventions.

### Project-Specific Confirmations

These operations ALWAYS require explicit confirmation:

**Dependency Changes:**
- Modifying `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` - affects all dependencies

**Submodule Operations:**
- Any command affecting `styles-legacy/` submodule - contains 2,844 upstream styles

**Main Branch Push:**
- `git push origin main` - even with pre-commit checks passed

**GitHub Operations:**
- `gh pr create` - confirm PR details and target branch

## Global Agent Integration

This project leverages global Claude Code agents from `~/.claude/` while adding CSL/Rust-specific context:

- **@planner**: Quick planning (≤3 questions with defaults) - use for straightforward feature planning
- **@dplanner**: Deep planning with research capabilities - use for complex architectural decisions
- **@builder**: Implementation specialist (2-retry cap, no questions) - use for coding tasks
- **@reviewer**: QA specialist with conflict detection - use proactively after code changes

**Specialized Style Agents (via `/style-evolve`):**
- **@dstyleplan**: Deep research and architectural design for new styles.
- **@styleplan**: Maintenance, bug fixes, and technical build planning.
Human-facing style command:
- Use **`/style-evolve`** for all style tasks.
- Modes: `upgrade`, `migrate`, `create`.

Internal style workflow skills:
- **Router**: `style-evolve` (entrypoint and delegation)
- **Pipeline**: `style-maintain`, `style-migrate-enhance`, `style-qa`
- **Workflow**: `pr-workflow-fast`

**Project-Specific Context Layers:**
When invoking these agents, they automatically receive CSL domain knowledge and Rust expertise from this file. The global agents handle general development workflow while project-specific instructions guide CSL/citation processing decisions.

## Task Management Workflow

**Primary System:** Local beans + GitHub Issues (for community)

For rapid development, use beans for local task management. GitHub Issues remain available for community contributions and long-term planning, but local beans tasks avoid sync overhead during active development.

### Quick Commands (Beans Skill)

Use `/beans` skill for fast local task management:
```
/beans list                           # Show all tasks
/beans next                           # Recommend best task to work on
/beans update BEAN_ID --status in-progress   # Mark task started
/beans update BEAN_ID --status completed     # Mark task done
/beans create "Title" --type bug --priority high
```

See `.claude/skills/beans/SKILL.md` for full command reference.

### Issue Templates
- **Bug Report** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`): Rendering defects, incorrect output
- **Feature Request** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`): New features, enhancements
- **Technical Debt** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/technical_debt.md`): Refactoring, cleanup

### Labels
- **Priority**: `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `tech-debt`, `refactor`
- **Category**: `rendering`, `numeric-styles`, `i18n`, `dx`

### When to Use Beans vs GitHub Issues

**Beans (Local Development):**
- Active development tasks and bug fixes
- Short-term planning and implementation tracking
- Breaking down feature branches into subtasks
- Dependency tracking with blocking relationships
- Fast iteration without network overhead
- Tasks tied to specific development sessions

**GitHub Issues (Community & Long-term):**
- Feature requests from community or domain experts
- Bug reports from external users
- Public roadmap and milestone tracking
- Coordination with contributors
- Long-term architectural planning
- Issues requiring public discussion

### Beans Workflow

```
1. Create task:     /beans create "Fix parser bug" --type bug --priority high
2. List pending:    /beans list --status todo
3. Find next:       /beans next
4. Start work:      /beans update BEAN_ID --status in-progress
5. View details:    /beans show BEAN_ID
6. Mark done:       /beans update BEAN_ID --status completed
7. Find next:       /beans next
```

All queries are instant (local markdown files, no API calls).

### Beans Storage

Tasks are stored in `.beans/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:
- `.beans.yml` - Configuration (prefix: csl26-, ID length: 4)
- `.beans/*.md` - Individual task files
- Git-friendly format for easy diff/review

## Project Goal

Transition the citation management ecosystem from CSL 1.0 (procedural XML) to CSLN (declarative, type-safe Rust/YAML). This involves:

1. **Parsing** legacy CSL 1.0 styles (`csl_legacy`)
2. **Migrating** to the new schema (`csln_migrate`)
3. **Processing** citations/bibliographies (`csln_processor`)
4. **Rendering** output that matches citeproc-js exactly

## Workspace Structure

```
crates/
  csl_legacy/      # CSL 1.0 XML parser (complete)
  csln/            # Main CLI binary (render/check/convert)
  csln_core/       # CSLN types: Style, Template, Options, Locale
  csln_migrate/    # CSL 1.0 → CSLN conversion
  csln_processor/  # Citation/bibliography rendering engine

styles/            # CSLN YAML styles
styles-legacy/     # 2,844 CSL 1.0 styles (submodule)
scripts/           # oracle.js for citeproc-js verification
tests/             # Integration tests
```

## Migration Strategy

**Current Approach:** Hybrid strategy combining XML options extraction with output-driven template generation.

See **[docs/architecture/MIGRATION_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md](./docs/architecture/MIGRATION_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md)** for full analysis.

**Key insight:** The XML semantic compiler excels at extracting global options (name formatting, et-al rules, dates, locales) achieving 87-100% citation match, but fails at template structure (0% bibliography match across all top parent styles) due to fundamental model mismatch between CSL 1.0's procedural approach and CSLN's declarative templates.

**Strategy:**
1. **Keep XML pipeline for OPTIONS** - Options extractor, preset detector, locale handling (~2,500 lines working code)
2. **LLM-author templates for top parent styles** - Using `/style-evolve` (or style agents) to create styles from reference materials with iterative test-fix loops. Validated with APA 7th (5/5 citation + bibliography match).
3. **Build output-driven template generator** - Use citeproc-js output + input data cross-referencing for component structure and ordering
4. **Retain XML compiler as fallback** - For rare reference types and validation
5. **Cross-validation** - Where both approaches agree, confidence is high
6. **Agent-assisted migration** - Use `./scripts/prep-migration.sh` to provide high-fidelity context for `/style-evolve migrate` when hand-authoring top styles.

**Current state:** The hybrid strategy is validated and deployed (PR #193). Top parent styles are being hand-authored via the `/style-evolve` workflow. See `docs/TIER_STATUS.md` for live fidelity metrics.

## Development Principles

### 1. High-Fidelity Data & Math Support

- **EDTF as Primary**: Prioritize Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) for all date fields. The engine must support ranges, uncertainty, and approximations natively.
- **Math in Variables**: Support mathematical notation and rich text within metadata variables (e.g., title or note). Prefer standard encodings (e.g., Unicode) over format-specific markup where possible, while ensuring the processor can handle complex fragments without corruption. Ref: csln#64
- **Scoped Multilingualism**: Support multilingual/multiscript data via field 'scopes' (e.g., author+an:mslang). Ref: csln#66
- **Contributor Distinction**: Maintain a strict distinction between individual and organizational authors.

### 2. Hybrid Processing Architecture

- **Dual-Mode Support**: The architecture must cater to both Batch Processing (CLI-based like Pandoc/LaTeX) and Interactive/Real-time usage (GUI-based like Word/Zotero).
- **JSON Server Mode**: Consider a service-oriented approach (similar to Haskell citeproc) where the engine can run as a background process to minimize startup latency for interactive apps.

### 3. Future-Proofing & Versioning (Stability)

- **Forward/Backward Compatibility**: We must ensure that a style written in 2026 works in 2030, and ideally, that a newer style degrades gracefully in an older engine.
- **Schema Evolution**: Utilize Serde's `#[serde(default)]` and `#[serde(flatten)]` to handle unknown or new fields gracefully. Implement a versioning strategy within the Rust types to allow for non-breaking extensions to the specification.

**Strategy: Strict Typing with Explicit Extensions**
1. **Explicit Versioning**: Styles include a `version` field for unambiguous schema identification.
2. **Strict Validation**: All types use `deny_unknown_fields` to catch typos and invalid fields at parse time.
3. **Explicit Extension Points**: Styles use explicit `custom: Option<HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>>` fields for user-defined metadata and extensions.
4. **Extension via Defaults**: All new features must be `Option<T>` with `#[serde(default)]`.

**Graceful Degradation for Multilingual Data**
- **Fallback Chain**: Multilingual fields must always implement a `Display` fallback (e.g., `Complex.original` -> `Simple string`).
- **Mode Fallback**: If a style requests a `translated` view but the data only provides `original`, the processor must return `original` rather than failing.

### 4. Multilingual Support

- **Explicit Language/Script Tagging**: All multilingual metadata uses BCP 47 tags with script and optional variant (e.g., "ja-Latn-hepburn" for Hepburn romanization)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Simple string → original → transliteration → translation fallback chain via `Display` trait
- **Surface-Level Disambiguation**: Disambiguation matches displayed written forms (transliterated strings if style shows transliteration), NOT PIDs (ORCID/DOI are for identity, not disambiguation)
- **Declarative Modes**: Styles declare viewing preference (original/transliterated/translated/combined) without procedural logic

### 5. Rust Engineering Standards (Code-as-Schema)

- **Serde-Driven Truth**: We use a Code-First approach. The Rust structs and enums are the source of truth for the schema.
- **Total Stability**: Prohibit the use of `unwrap()` or `unsafe`. Use idiomatic Rust `Result` patterns for all processing logic.

### 6. Explicit Over Magic

**The style language should be explicit; the processor should be dumb.**

If special behavior is needed (e.g., different punctuation for journals vs books), it should be expressed in the style YAML, not hardcoded in the processor.

Bad (magic in processor):
```rust
// Processor has hidden logic for journal articles
if ref_type == "article-journal" {
    separator = ", ";
}
```

Good (explicit in style):
```yaml
# Style explicitly declares type-specific behavior
- title: parent-serial
  overrides:
    article-journal:
      suffix: ","
```

This makes styles portable, testable, and understandable without reading processor code.

### 7. Declarative Templates

Replace CSL 1.0's procedural `<choose>/<if>` with flat templates + type overrides:
```yaml
bibliography:
  template:
    - contributor: author
      form: long
    - date: issued
      form: year
      wrap: parentheses
    - title: primary
    - variable: publisher
      overrides:
        article-journal:
          suppress: true  # Journals don't show publisher
```

### 8. Structured Name Input

Names must be structured (`family`/`given` or `literal`), never parsed from strings. Corporate names can contain commas.

### 9. Oracle Verification

All changes must pass the verification loop:
1. Render with citeproc-js → String A
2. Render with CSLN → String B
3. **Pass**: A == B (for supported features)

### 9a. Dual Metrics: Fidelity + SQI

Use two metrics with clear priority:

1. **Fidelity** (oracle match) is the hard gate.
2. **SQI** (Style Quality Index) is a secondary optimization metric.

Policy:
- Never accept an SQI improvement that causes a fidelity regression.
- Use SQI to break ties when multiple implementations have comparable fidelity.
- Prefer SQI improvements that increase fallback robustness and concision
  without changing rendered output.
- When tradeoffs are unavoidable during iteration, restore fidelity before
  merge and document temporary SQI/fidelity drift explicitly.

### 10. Well-Commented Code

Code should be self-documenting with clear comments explaining:
- **Why** decisions were made, not just what the code does
- Non-obvious behavior or edge cases
- References to CSL 1.0 spec where relevant
- Known limitations or TODOs

## Documentation Quality

For human-oriented documentation (READMEs, guides, architecture docs), use the `/humanizer` skill to ensure clarity and readability while maintaining technical precision.

**Scope:**
- Applies to: Markdown files in `docs/`, root-level READMEs (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`), architecture documentation
- Does NOT apply to: Inline code comments, API documentation, error messages, technical specifications

**Humanizer Rules:**
- Follow all humanizer recommendations except rule 18
- Rule 18 (curly quotes) is explicitly excluded - technical documentation may use typographic quotes intentionally
- Rule 13 (em dash moderation) triggers only when 3+ em dashes appear in a single paragraph - em dashes have legitimate uses for parenthetical clarifications in technical writing

**Usage:**
Use `/humanizer` on documentation files before finalizing user-facing content. This is guidance for review, not a mandatory pre-commit check.

## Verification Requirements

Different types of changes require different levels of verification to maintain quality while optimizing for development velocity.

| Change Type | Verification Required |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Config/Docs/Styles (<5 lines) | Syntax check only |
| Bugfixes (non-hot path) | `cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test` |
| New features (cold path) | `cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test` |
| Hot path refactoring | Pre-commit checks + **Benchmarks** (before/after) |
| Algorithm changes | Pre-commit checks + **Benchmarks** (regression check) |
| Format/Parser optimization | Pre-commit checks + **Benchmarks** (validated claim) |
| Performance claims | Pre-commit checks + **Benchmarks** (evidence-based) |

**Hot paths:** citation rendering, bibliography processing, style parsing, name formatting, date formatting, substitution logic

### Benchmark Workflow (Required for Performance/Refactor Work)

Benchmarks are **required** for performance-sensitive changes and hot-path refactors. Use the provided helper script to automate comparison.

```bash
# 1. Capture baseline (on main or before changes)
./scripts/bench-check.sh baseline

# 2. Make performance changes
# ... implement optimization ...

# 3. Compare after changes
./scripts/bench-check.sh baseline after

# 4. Include relevant deltas in commit message body
```

**Available benchmarks:**
- `cargo bench --bench rendering` - Citation/bibliography processing (APA-focused)
- `cargo bench --bench formats` - YAML/JSON/CBOR deserialization

Baseline files are stored in `.bench-baselines/` (gitignored, local-only). Use `critcmp` for manual comparisons if needed.

## Current Status

Oracle scoring uses the strict 8-scenario citation set (`tests/fixtures/citations-expanded.json`),
which hard-fails on processor/style errors and includes edge-case variants (suppress-author,
mixed locator/prefix/suffix). See `docs/TIER_STATUS.md` for the live per-style breakdown.

- **APA 7th**: 8/8 citations ✅, 27/27 bibliography ✅
- **Batch (top 10 styles)**: 0/10 at strict 100% citation match; top hit rates at 7/8
- **Bibliography top rates**: APA 27/27, Springer Basic 26/28, Elsevier With Titles 25/28
- **Locale**: en-US with terms, months, contributor roles, page labels ("pp.")
- **Key Features**: Variable-once rule, type-specific overrides, name_order control, initials formatting, volume(issue) grouping, page label extraction

### Known Gaps
- Volume-pages delimiter varies by style (comma vs colon)
- DOI suppression for styles that don't output DOI
- Editor name-order varies by style (given-first vs family-first)

## Feature Priority (Based on Corpus Analysis)

Run `cargo run --bin csln-analyze -- styles/` to regenerate these statistics.

| Volume-pages delimiter | - | Varies by style (comma vs colon) |
| DOI suppression | - | Some styles don't output DOI |
| Editor name-order | - | given-first vs family-first varies by style |

### Medium Priority (Note Styles)
| Feature | Usage | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `position` conditions | 2,431 uses | ibid, subsequent, first |
| Note style class | 542 styles | 19% of corpus |

## Personas

When designing features or writing code, evaluate your decisions against the [CSLN Design Personas](./docs/architecture/PERSONAS.md). This ensures we satisfy the needs of style authors, web developers, systems architects, and domain experts.

## Prior Art

Before designing new features, consult [PRIOR_ART.md](./docs/architecture/PRIOR_ART.md) to understand how existing systems (CSL 1.0, CSL-M, biblatex, citeproc-rs) handle similar problems. Key references:

- **CSL 1.0**: Established vocabulary, locale system, 2,844+ styles
- **CSL-M**: Legal citations, multilingual locale layouts, institutional names
- **biblatex**: Flat options architecture, EDTF dates, sorting templates
- **citeproc-rs**: Rust implementation patterns, incremental computation, WASM bindings

### Feature Roadmap (from Prior Art)

| Priority | Feature | Source | Issue |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| High | EDTF native date handling | biblatex | - |
| High | Locale-specific template sections | CSL-M | #66 |
| High | Entry-level `language` field | biblatex/CSL-M | #66 |
| High | Pluggable renderers (HTML, LaTeX, Typst) | citeproc-rs, jotdown | #105 |
| Medium | Presets for common configurations | CSLN-native | #89 |
| Medium | Hyperlink configuration | CSL Appendix VI | #155 |
| Medium | Separate citation/bibliography name limits | biblatex | #64 |
| Medium | Sorting shortcuts (`nty`, `ynt`) | biblatex | #61 |
| Medium | Legal citations (Tier 1: core types) | CSL-M | csl26-rmoi |
| Medium | Legal citations (Tier 2: specialist features) | CSL-M | csl26-rmoi |
| Medium | Djot integration (documents + fields) | - | #86 |
| Low | Incremental computation (salsa) | citeproc-rs | - |

## Design Documents

Architectural decisions and design rationale:

- **[STYLE_ALIASING.md](./docs/architecture/design/STYLE_ALIASING.md)**: Style aliasing and presets strategy. Recommends presets for configuration reuse instead of CSL 1.0's parent/child aliasing. Refs: #89
- **[STYLE_EDITOR_VISION.md](./docs/architecture/design/STYLE_EDITOR_VISION.md)**: User stories and API requirements for a web-based style editor. Ensures the core library supports progressive-refinement UIs and JSON API exposure.
- **[LEGAL_CITATIONS.md](./docs/architecture/design/LEGAL_CITATIONS.md)**: Two-tier legal citation architecture. Core legal types (Tier 1) for academics citing legal materials in APA/Chicago/MLA, optional specialist features (Tier 2) for Bluebook/ALWD. Refs: csl26-rmoi
- **[TYPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/architecture/design/TYPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Analysis of structural vs flat type system approaches. Recommends hybrid model (structural for academic, flat for legal/domain-specific) with documented type addition policy. Refs: csl26-wodz
- **[TYPE_ADDITION_POLICY.md](./docs/architecture/TYPE_ADDITION_POLICY.md)**: **Active policy** for deciding when to add new reference types. Uses 4-factor test (semantic distinction, style discrimination, field schema difference, no meaningful parent). Hybrid model balances data efficiency with style clarity.
- **[SQI_REFINEMENT_PLAN.md](./docs/architecture/SQI_REFINEMENT_PLAN.md)**: Portfolio-wide plan for raising Style Quality Index across all core styles while preserving fidelity as the hard gate.

## Skills

Specialized expertise is available via the following skills in `.claude/skills/`:

- **[rust-pro](./.claude/skills/rust-pro/SKILL.md)**: Modern Rust engineering (1.75+), async patterns, and performance optimization. Use proactively for core processor development.
- **[git-advanced-workflows](./.claude/skills/git-advanced-workflows/SKILL.md)**: Advanced Git operations (rebasing, cherry-picking, bisecting).
- **[style-evolve](./.claude/skills/style-evolve/SKILL.md)**: Human-facing style command (`upgrade`, `migrate`, `create`) with required style+processor co-evolution checks.
- **Internal pipeline skills**: `style-maintain`, `style-migrate-enhance`, `style-qa`, `pr-workflow-fast`.
- **Human onboarding guide**: [STYLE_EVOLVE_WORKFLOW.md](./docs/guides/STYLE_EVOLVE_WORKFLOW.md).

### Style Classes
- **in-text**: 2,302 styles (80.9%) - author-date
- **note**: 542 styles (19.1%) - footnote-based

## Issue Handling

### Domain Expert Context Packets

We use a specific issue template for Domain Experts to provide semantic context. When working on these issues:

1.  **Analyze Context First**: Read the "Domain Context", "Reference Materials", and "Real-World Examples" sections carefully.
2.  **Extract Rules**: Before writing code, explicitly state the rules you have extracted from the provided PDF/HTML references.
3.  **Identify Schema vs Logic**: Determine if the request requires a new schema field (in `csln_core`) or just a processing change (in `csln_processor`).
4.  **Verify Constraints**: Check the "Constraints" section for strict prohibitions (e.g., "Never use italics").

## Git Workflow (Rapid Development Mode)

**During rapid development, direct commits to `main` are allowed** to optimize for velocity and message economy (Pro Plan constraints). This mode is active until the project approaches production or onboards external contributors.

### Mandatory Pre-Commit Checks

**CRITICAL: Before committing Rust code changes (`.rs` files, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`) to main, you MUST run:**

```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```

These checks are non-negotiable for Rust changes:
1. **`cargo fmt`** - Format code (CI will fail without this)
2. **`cargo clippy`** - Zero tolerance for warnings
3. **`cargo test`** - All tests must pass

**If ANY check fails, DO NOT commit. Fix the issues first.**

**For documentation-only or style-only changes** (`.md` files, `.yaml` files in `styles/`), these checks are NOT required.

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow these conventions for all commits:
- **Conventional Commits**: Use `type(scope): subject` format.
- **Lowercase Subject**: Subject lines must be lowercase.
- **50/72 Rule**: Limit the subject line to 50 characters and wrap the body at 72 characters.
- **Explain What and Why**: The body should explain the rationale behind the change.
- **Issue References**: Include GitHub issue references where relevant (e.g., `Refs: #123` or `csln#64`).
- **Plain Text Body**: Do NOT use Markdown in the commit body. Uses asterisks for bullet points is okay, but do not backtick code elements.
- **No Literal `\n`**: Never include escaped newline sequences in commit text; create paragraph breaks with separate `-m` flags or `git commit -F`.
- **No Escaped Backticks**: Never escape backticks (e.g., write `code` not \`code\`).
- **No Co-Authored-By**: Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` footers in AI-authored commit messages.

Example (Rust code change):
```bash
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo nextest run && \
git add -A && git commit -m "fix(migrate): prevent duplicate list variables

Add post-processing step to detect variables appearing in both
List components and standalone components, adding suppress overrides
to prevent duplication in rendered output.

Refs: csl26-6whe, #127"
```

Example (documentation-only change):
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "docs: clarify migration strategy

Update [MIGRATION_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md](./docs/architecture/MIGRATION_STRATEGY_ANALYSIS.md) to reflect hybrid approach
findings from APA 7th validation testing."
```

### When to Use Feature Branches (Optional)

Feature branches are **optional** but recommended for:
- Major architectural changes requiring extended review
- Risky experiments that might need rollback
- Changes you want to checkpoint before pushing to main

For normal bug fixes, small features, and refactoring, commit directly to main.

### Workflow Example

**Standard (direct to main):**
```bash
# 1. Make changes
# 2. If Rust code changed: run pre-commit checks and commit
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo nextest run && git add -A && git commit -m "fix: your message"
# 2. If docs/styles only: commit directly
git add -A && git commit -m "docs: your message"
# 3. Push to main
git push origin main
```

**Optional (feature branch for major changes):**
```bash
# 1. Create checkpoint branch
git checkout -b feat/major-change
# 2. Make changes
# 3. If Rust code changed: run pre-commit checks and commit
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo nextest run && git add -A && git commit -m "feat: your message"
# 4. Push branch
git push -u origin feat/major-change
# 5. Optionally create PR for review, or merge locally and push to main
```

### Switching to PR Workflow

When the project reaches these milestones, switch back to mandatory PR workflow:
- Approaching production release
- Onboarding external contributors
- User requests stricter review process

At that point, restore the "NEVER commit to main" rule.

## Pull Request Convention (Optional)

**PRs are optional during rapid development.** Use them only when:
- You want feedback before merging a major architectural change
- Creating a checkpoint for later review
- Documenting complex changes with detailed PR description

**When you do create PRs:**

**Draft vs Ready:**
- **Draft PR** = Work in progress, more commits expected
- **Regular PR** = Complete and ready for immediate merge

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation changes

**Remember:** All pre-commit checks (fmt, clippy, test) must pass before creating PR.

## Coding Standards

- Use `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]` for YAML/JSON compatibility
- Use `#[non_exhaustive]` for extensible enums
- Use `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` on untagged enum variants to prevent misparse
- Prefer `Option<T>` with `skip_serializing_if` for optional fields
- Add `#[serde(flatten)]` for inline rendering options
- Comment non-obvious logic; reference CSL 1.0 spec where applicable

## Priority Styles

**Important**: Do not over-optimize for any single style. Test changes against multiple parent styles to avoid regressions.

See **[docs/reference/STYLE_PRIORITY.md](./docs/reference/STYLE_PRIORITY.md)** for detailed impact analysis based on dependent style counts.

### Top Parent Styles by Impact

The CSL repository has ~7,987 dependent styles that alias ~300 parent styles. Prioritize by dependent count:

| Parent Style | Dependents | Format | Impact |
|-------------|------------|--------|--------|
| apa | 783 | author-date | 9.8% |
| elsevier-with-titles | 672 | numeric | 8.4% |
| elsevier-harvard | 665 | author-date | 8.3% |
| springer-basic-author-date | 460 | author-date | 5.8% |
| ieee | 176 | numeric | 2.2% |

**The top 10 parent styles cover 60% of dependent styles.**

### Development Order

1. **Author-date styles first** (40% of corpus) - APA, Elsevier Harvard, Springer, Chicago
2. **Numeric + Note styles in parallel** - Elsevier Vancouver, IEEE, AMA alongside Chicago Notes, OSCOLA
   - Note styles are 2% of the corpus but represent high-visibility use cases (humanities, legal)
   - Chicago Notes is a named target for this wave
   - Legal styles (OSCOLA, Bluebook) overlap with the legal citation roadmap (csl26-rmoi)
   - Ibid/position support is a CSLN differentiator; deferring it understates its adoption value

### Measuring Impact

When reporting progress, calculate impact as:
```
Impact = sum(dependent_count for passing parent styles) / 7987 * 100
```

### Running the Analyzer

```bash
# Rank parent styles by dependent count
cargo run --bin csln-analyze -- styles-legacy/ --rank-parents

# Filter by citation format
cargo run --bin csln-analyze -- styles-legacy/ --rank-parents --format author-date --json
