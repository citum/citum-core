Coordinator for driving all four Chicago variants from their real baseline to
~100% fidelity + clean SQI, via the `style-tune` skill, one variant per child
bean. Supersedes the prior "final tuning pass" framing, which understated the
gap — baseline below was unchanged-codebase, freshly measured.

## Baseline (measured 2026-06-30, `node scripts/report-core.js`, `chicago-shared-corpus` run — 15 citations / 402 bibliography refs)

| variant | citations | bibliography | gated in CI? |
|---|---|---|---|
| chicago-author-date-18th | 11/15 (73%) | 298/402 (74%) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 309/417 = 0.741, `min_pass_rate: 0.73` |
| chicago-notes-18th | 7/15 (47%) | — (no bibliography surface) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, citation-only rate 0.467, `min_pass_rate: 0.46` |
| chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography | 6/15 (40%) | 264/402 (66%) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 270/417 = 0.647, `min_pass_rate: 0.64` |
| taylor-and-francis-chicago-author-date | 11/15 (73%) | 298/402 (74%, inherits author-date) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 309/417 = 0.741, `min_pass_rate: 0.73` |

## Gating policy — implemented (this PR)

`chicago-shared-corpus` is now `count_toward_fidelity: true` on all four
variants in `scripts/report-data/verification-policy.yaml`, with interim
`min_pass_rate` floors set just below the 2026-06-30 baseline above (the
*combined* citation+bibliography match rate that `report-core.js`'s
`determineBenchmarkStatus` actually computes, not a naive average of the two
surface percentages). Floors lock against regression during tuning; ratchet
upward per variant as each is tuned toward 100%.

`chicago-author-date-18th`'s old `chicago-zotero-bibliography` run (same
402-ref `chicago-18th.json` fixture) is demoted to diagnostic
(`count_toward_fidelity: false`) — leaving both runs `true` would have
double-counted that fixture into the headline `fidelityScore`, since
`report-core.js` additively merges every `count_toward_fidelity: true` run
for a style. This also retires the fragmentation flagged on #987.

Note: none of this is a hard CI merge-blocking gate today —
`scripts/check-core-quality.js`'s hard `fidelityScore === 1.0` check only
applies to styles listed in `scripts/report-data/core-quality-baseline.json`,
which does not include any of the four Chicago variants. The `min_pass_rate`
floors above are scored and shown as pass/fail in `report-core.js` output
(visibility/regression-tracking), not wired into a failing CI step. Wiring a
hard gate is a separate decision, not made here — it would currently be
unmeetable (fidelityScore == 1.0) and would block unrelated engine/migrate PRs.

## Tuning order (recommended, encoded in the child-bean `blocked_by` graph below — not separately ratified)

author-date → T&F → notes → shortened. T&F-core extends
`chicago-author-date-18th`, so author-date gains lift T&F before its Style-F
deltas apply. `chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography-core` extends
`chicago-notes-18th`, so notes is tuned before shortened inherits its citation
gains, leaving shortened to only need its own bibliography surface tuned.
Author-date/T&F (73-74%) are closest to the bar; notes (47%) and shortened
(40%) need the most work but inherit upstream wins.

## Todo (restructured 2026-08-07, see docs/specs/CHICAGO_FAMILY_STRATEGY.md)
- [x] Decide and implement the gating-policy recommendation above
- [x] Restructure from per-style tuning (csl26-giun, csl26-7jht — both
      scrapped, evidence preserved) to per-defect-cluster children, since the
      per-style loop repeatedly deferred the same structural defects across
      six-plus sessions instead of converging
- [x] csl26-ey4f: Cluster 1 — contributor-role/pattern localization
      (completed; landed in PR #1151, no exact-parity movement by design —
      see csl26-ey4f/csl26-dfq0 for the localization-coverage numbers that
      metric can't show)
- [x] csl26-87yl: Cluster 2 — title quoting boundary by source type
      (landed article-newspaper + thesis quoting fixes; author-date/T&F
      172/546 -> 173/546; notes/shortened unchanged; map + notes-family
      dataset/report/thesis/webpage deferred, see csl26-87yl summary)
- [ ] csl26-vf5x: Cluster 3 — container-title terminal punctuation
      (re-verified 2026-08-08: described pattern not found in current
      failures, likely stale — needs fresh re-derivation before starting)
- [ ] csl26-yqma: Cluster 4 — name-list conjunction punctuation
      (re-verified 2026-08-08: same — largely unconfirmable in current
      author-date/T&F data, needs fresh re-derivation)
- [ ] csl26-cz0p: Cluster 5 — archival/manuscript/document-routed refs
      (re-verified 2026-08-08: strongly confirmed — document 35/35,
      manuscript 13/15 failing, identical across author-date-18th/T&F)
- [ ] csl26-rpza: Cluster 6 — broadcast/episode grammar
      (re-verified 2026-08-08: strongly confirmed — broadcast 8/8,
      motion_picture 8/8 failing everywhere; speech/song show the same
      shape and aren't yet in scope)
- [ ] csl26-s2kt: Cluster 7 — multi-volume/legal/patents/original-reprint trailers
      (re-verified 2026-08-08: strongly confirmed — legal_case,
      legislation, treaty, regulation, hearing, standard all at or near
      100% failure across all three comparable styles)
- [x] csl26-zl7f: chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography-core's
      bibliography.options.separator was ", " instead of ". " —
      landed 2026-08-08. Measured impact: exactParity 13/473 -> 20/473
      (+7), not the ~326 the original signature-match estimate implied;
      most of those entries carry a second, independent defect that
      this fix alone doesn't clear. Still worth keeping — every entry's
      top-level delimiter is now correct regardless.
- [ ] Triage the 13 additional near-100%-failing reference types found
      2026-08-08 (interview, thesis, webpage, entry-encyclopedia,
      entry-dictionary, dataset, post, post-weblog, article, software,
      map, graphic, personal_communication — see gap note below) into
      new cluster bean(s), or fold into existing ones if they share a
      root cause
- [ ] Final `report-core.js` sweep confirming all four styles' exact parity
      moved upward from the 2026-08-07 baseline (author-date 172/546, T&F
      172/546, notes 22/72, shortened 13/473); ratchet `min_pass_rate` floors
      upward as each cluster clears


## Gap found while re-verifying clusters 3-7 (2026-08-08)

Cross-referenced every currently-failing exactParity bibliography entry (chicago-author-date-18th, taylor-and-francis-chicago-author-date, chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography; `node scripts/report-core.js`, references-expanded + chicago-18th corpora) against reference type. Clusters 3-7 (csl26-vf5x/yqma/cz0p/rpza/s2kt, updated with fresh counts) cover document, manuscript, broadcast, motion_picture, legal_case, legislation, treaty, regulation, hearing, bill, patent, standard, report, article-journal, article-magazine, article-newspaper. The following types are also failing at or near 100% across all three styles and aren't in any of the five clusters' scope:

| type | author-date-18th | T&F | shortened |
|---|---|---|---|
| interview | 11/11 | 11/11 | 9/9 |
| thesis | 6/6 | 6/6 | 5/5 |
| webpage | 15/16 | 15/16 | 15/15 |
| entry-encyclopedia | 7/7 | 7/7 | 6/6 |
| entry-dictionary | 4/4 | 4/4 | 2/3 |
| dataset | 4/6 | 4/6 | 5/5 |
| post | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 |
| post-weblog | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| article | 3/3 | 3/3 | 3/3 |
| software | 5/5 | 5/5 | 4/4 |
| map | 5/5 | 5/5 | 4/4 |
| graphic | 4/4 | 4/4 | 4/4 |
| personal_communication | 6/7 | 6/7 | 0/0 |

Not proposing new cluster beans unilaterally -- this needs the same "is it one shared-template gap or several" triage the existing five clusters got before being split out. Flagging so the next planning pass treats the 5-cluster list as a subset of the remaining gap, not the whole of it.

Also: chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography had a single-cause defect independent of all of the above -- a wrong `bibliography.options.separator` value (comma instead of period), tracked and fixed as csl26-zl7f. 326 of its 422 failing bibliography entries matched that signature, but the fix's measured impact was smaller than that count implied (exactParity 13/473 -> 20/473, +7) -- most of the flagged entries carry a second, independent defect the separator fix alone doesn't clear. See csl26-zl7f for the full before/after and the note on why the signature count overstated the gain.
