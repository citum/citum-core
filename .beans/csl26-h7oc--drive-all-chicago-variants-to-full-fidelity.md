Coordinator for driving all four Chicago variants from their real baseline to
~100% fidelity + clean SQI, via the `style-tune` skill, one variant per child
bean. Supersedes the prior "final tuning pass" framing, which understated the
gap — baseline below was unchanged-codebase, freshly measured.

## Baseline (measured 2026-06-30, `node scripts/report-core.js`, `chicago-shared-corpus` run — 15 citations / 402 bibliography refs)

| variant | citations | bibliography | gated in CI? |
|---|---|---|---|
| chicago-author-date-18th | 11/15 (73%) | 298/402 (74%) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 309/417 = 0.741, `min_pass_rate: 0.73` |
| chicago-notes-18th | 7/15 (47%) | — (no bibliography surface) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, citation-only rate 0.467, `min_pass_rate: 0.46` |
| chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography | 6/15 (40%) | 264/402 (66%) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 270/417 = 0.647, `min_pass_rate: 0.64` |
| taylor-and-francis-chicago-author-date | 11/15 (73%) | 298/402 (74%, inherits author-date) | yes — `chicago-shared-corpus`, combined rate 309/417 = 0.741, `min_pass_rate: 0.73` |

## Gating policy — implemented (this PR)

`chicago-shared-corpus` is now `count_toward_fidelity: true` on all four
variants in `scripts/report-data/verification-policy.yaml`, with interim
`min_pass_rate` floors set just below the 2026-06-30 baseline above (the
*combined* citation+bibliography match rate that `report-core.js`'s
`determineBenchmarkStatus` actually computes, not a naive average of the two
surface percentages). Floors lock against regression during tuning; ratchet
upward per variant as each is tuned toward 100%.

`chicago-author-date-18th`'s old `chicago-zotero-bibliography` run (same
402-ref `chicago-18th.json` fixture) is demoted to diagnostic
(`count_toward_fidelity: false`) — leaving both runs `true` would have
double-counted that fixture into the headline `fidelityScore`, since
`report-core.js` additively merges every `count_toward_fidelity: true` run
for a style. This also retires the fragmentation flagged on #987.

Note: none of this is a hard CI merge-blocking gate today —
`scripts/check-core-quality.js`'s hard `fidelityScore === 1.0` check only
applies to styles listed in `scripts/report-data/core-quality-baseline.json`,
which does not include any of the four Chicago variants. The `min_pass_rate`
floors above are scored and shown as pass/fail in `report-core.js` output
(visibility/regression-tracking), not wired into a failing CI step. Wiring a
hard gate is a separate decision, not made here — it would currently be
unmeetable (fidelityScore == 1.0) and would block unrelated engine/migrate PRs.

## Tuning order (recommended, encoded in the child-bean `blocked_by` graph below — not separately ratified)

author-date → T&F → notes → shortened. T&F-core extends
`chicago-author-date-18th`, so author-date gains lift T&F before its Style-F
deltas apply. `chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography-core` extends
`chicago-notes-18th`, so notes is tuned before shortened inherits its citation
gains, leaving shortened to only need its own bibliography surface tuned.
Author-date/T&F (73-74%) are closest to the bar; notes (47%) and shortened
(40%) need the most work but inherit upstream wins.

## Todo
- [x] Decide and implement the gating-policy recommendation above
- [ ] Land child tune: chicago-author-date-18th
- [ ] Land child tune: taylor-and-francis-chicago-author-date
- [ ] Land child tune: chicago-notes-18th
- [ ] Land child tune: chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography
- [ ] Final `report-core.js` sweep confirming all four at target; ratchet
      `min_pass_rate` floors upward as each variant clears them
