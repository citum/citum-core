Epic to track the template compilation improvements needed for bibliography rendering. The delimiter infrastructure (Tasks #1-6) is working, but migration has deeper issues in component selection, ordering, and suppress logic. Oracle verification shows 0/10 top parent styles with perfect bibliography match despite 60% citation match. This epic tracks the systematic fixes needed in citum_migrate/src/template_compiler/.
