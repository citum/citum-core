# Forward-Compatibility Specification

**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2026-05-15
**Related:** bean `csl26-2a0b`, bean `csl26-fuw7`, `docs/architecture/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`, `docs/reference/SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md`, `docs/policies/ENUM_VOCABULARY_POLICY.md`, `docs/architecture/EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md`

## Purpose

Define the contract that an older Citum engine must honor when it parses a
newer style, reference, or locale that uses features it does not yet
understand. The goal is to make most non-template feature additions safe to
ship as a `minor` schema bump: producers can ship styles or data using new
options, attribute enum values, or locale terms without breaking older
engines. Older engines surface a single, consistent warning channel instead
of raw serde errors.

Template grammar changes and brand-new top-level reference classes are
explicitly out of scope: those remain `major`-level changes that older
engines may reject.

## Scope

**In scope** (must soft-degrade with a warning):

- Additive variants on attribute enums referenced inside templates or
  inside already-dispatched reference structs:
  `ContributorRole`, `MonographType`, `SerialComponentType`,
  `CollectionType`, `MonographComponentType`, `TermForm`, `DateForm`,
  `NumberingType`, `GrammaticalGender`.
- New optional fields on style option structs (anywhere
  `deny_unknown_fields` is currently applied in
  `crates/citum-schema-style/`).
- New optional fields on reference data types
  (`crates/citum-schema-data/src/reference/types/`).
- New optional top-level sections in a `Style` document.
- New locale term keys that a style references but the engine's vocabulary
  does not yet enumerate.
- New `custom.<namespace>.*` keys (the existing inert-metadata escape
  hatch from [`EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md`](../architecture/EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md)).

**Out of scope** (older engines may hard-fail; producers must bump major):

- Changes to template grammar — new required variants of
  `TemplateComponent`, new required fields on an existing template
  component, changed semantics of an existing variant.
- Unknown values of the top-level `InputReference::class` discriminator.
  See [§ InputReference discriminator](#inputreference-discriminator).
- Renames or removals of any field, variant, or term key. See
  [`ENUM_VOCABULARY_POLICY.md` §Backward Compatibility](../policies/ENUM_VOCABULARY_POLICY.md).

This spec governs **forward** compatibility (old engine reads new data).
**Backward** compatibility (new engine reads old data) is delivered by
`#[serde(default)]` + `Option<T>` on every additive field; that part of
the contract is already enforced by code review and is not restated here.

## Outcome classes

Every loadable artifact (style, reference, locale) lands in exactly one
outcome class when an older engine reads it:

| Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Pass` | The new feature was silently accepted and the artifact behaves as if the feature were absent. No warning emitted. Used for inert metadata (`custom.*`) and for new fields the older engine simply ignores. |
| `SoftDegrade` | The new feature was acknowledged but its effect was dropped or replaced with a documented fallback. A warning is emitted through the documented channel. The render still produces output. |
| `HardFail` | Parse or load returned an error. No render. Used only for grammar-level changes the engine cannot reason about and for unknown top-level reference classes. |

`SoftDegrade` is the dominant target. `Pass` is acceptable only when the
older engine genuinely cannot infer the producer's intent (e.g.
namespaced custom keys). `HardFail` is reserved for the out-of-scope
categories above.

## Warning channel

All `SoftDegrade` outcomes surface through one channel so consumers — the
CLI, `citum-hub`, the language bindings — present them uniformly. The
channel already exists in skeletal form at
`crates/citum-cli/src/commands.rs:1716`, where `citum check` compares
`style.version` against `SchemaVersion::default()` and emits a warning
when minor > supported minor.

The channel must be extended so that:

1. Engine load APIs (`Style::from_yaml_str`, `Locale::from_yaml_str`,
   reference loaders in `citum-io`) accumulate `CompatibilityWarning`
   records during parse instead of returning early with a serde error
   for additive cases.
2. `citum check` reports each warning with the field path, the offending
   value, the fallback applied, and the schema version that introduced
   the feature (when known).
3. Bindings expose the warning list on the returned style / reference /
   locale handle.

The shape of `CompatibilityWarning` is intentionally left to the
follow-up implementation beans; this spec only fixes the contract.

## Scope table

Each row is anchored to one or more cases in
`crates/citum-engine/tests/forward_compatibility.rs`. The columns below
measure **loader behavior** and align row-for-row with
`crates/citum-engine/tests/snapshots/forward_compat_gaps.snap` — the
truth-of-record. End-to-end user-visible outcomes may add a warning via
`citum check` on top of a loader `Pass`; see row 10.

| # | Category | Example | Declared | Observed | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Attribute enum in template | `contributor: producer` (new `ContributorRole`) | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-ld6e` tolerant enum deserializer |
| 2 | Attribute enum in data | `class: monograph, type: dance-performance` | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-ld6e` |
| 2b | Top-level `class` value | `class: dance-performance` | `HardFail` | `HardFail` | `csl26-1bdr` (post-1.0 design) |
| 3 | TermForm in template | `term: page, form: vocative` (new `TermForm`) | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-ld6e` |
| 4 | DateForm in template | `date: issued, form: month-and-day` (new `DateForm`) | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-ld6e` |
| 5 | New style option key | `options.contributors.future-key: true` | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-0ksu` capture-unknown-fields wrapper |
| 6 | New top-level style section | `experiments: { ... }` | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-0ksu` |
| 7 | New reference field | `audience: scholarly` on `Monograph` | `SoftDegrade` | `Pass` (silent — known gap) | `csl26-acfh` reference-data silent-acceptance |
| 8 | New `GeneralTerm` in template | `term: preprint-server` (unknown `GeneralTerm`) | `SoftDegrade` | `HardFail` | `csl26-o1z5` tolerant locale lookup |
| 9 | Custom namespace | `custom.publisher-x.foo: true` | `Pass` | `Pass` | — |
| 10 | Style version bumped | `version: "99.0"` on otherwise valid style | `Pass` | `Pass` | — (see footnote) |
| 11 | Template grammar add | hypothetical `loop:` variant | `HardFail` | `HardFail` | — (opt-out by design) |
| 12 | Malformed template shape | typoed `variable` body | `HardFail` | `HardFail` | — (opt-out by design) |

**Row 10 footnote.** The loader correctly accepts a style whose `version`
declares a newer minor than the engine knows. The user-visible
`SoftDegrade` is delivered by `citum check`
(`crates/citum-cli/src/commands.rs:1716`), which compares
`style.version` against `SchemaVersion::default()` and emits a clean
warning when minor > supported minor. The snapshot measures the loader
only; end-to-end the composition is `loader Pass + citum check warning =
SoftDegrade`.

## InputReference discriminator

`InputReference` uses `#[serde(tag = "class")]` at
`crates/citum-schema-data/src/reference/mod.rs:74`. The tag value
determines which concrete struct (`Monograph`, `SerialComponent`,
`LegalCase`, …) the rest of the payload deserializes into. An unknown
`class` value has no struct shape to fall into; serde cannot type the
payload at all.

**Pre-1.0 stance (current).** New top-level reference classes are the
second opt-out category alongside template grammar. Producers must
introduce them as a `major` bump; older engines hard-fail. Pre-1.0 the
engine has no published older-engine population to honor, so the cost
of a hard-break on `class` rebases the design question to "do we ever
need anything else?" — and the answer today is no.

**Post-1.0 future work.** Once crates have a real wild-engine
population, we may want to keep the headline rule ("new features warn,
not break") even for new classes. The shape that delivers that is a
catch-all variant —
`InputReference::Unknown(UnknownReference { class: String, fields:
serde_json::Map<String, Value> })` — which round-trips the data, emits
a `SoftDegrade` warning, and degrades to a generic rendering path. We
defer this design until there is real-world evidence that brand-new
classes are common enough to warrant the engineering cost. Tracked in
bean `csl26-1bdr`.

## Producer obligations

Style and tool authors:

1. **Bump `style.version`** whenever the style uses a feature added in a
   newer schema minor. The `version` is the primary signal `citum check`
   uses to emit the global "this style targets a newer engine" warning.
2. **Prefer `custom.<namespace>.*`** for genuinely experimental or
   institution-specific metadata. The portable schema is not the right
   incubation surface; see
   [`EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md`](../architecture/EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md).
3. **Treat template grammar changes as `major`-only.** New
   `TemplateComponent` variants and changes to existing-component
   shapes are not forward-compatible and must not ship as `minor`.

## Consumer obligations

Engine and binding authors:

1. **Never lose data silently.** Any feature that the older engine
   cannot honor must produce a `CompatibilityWarning`. Silent `Pass` is
   reserved for namespaced `custom.*` and for cases where the data
   simply has no effect on rendering.
2. **Render must still produce output** in every `SoftDegrade` case.
   The user should see what the older engine *could* do, plus a
   warning.
3. **Surface warnings through the documented channel** rather than
   inventing a new one.

## Promotion path

Borrowed from
[`EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md`](../architecture/EXTENSIBILITY_STRATEGY_2026-03-14.md)
and applied here:

1. New behavior starts as `custom.<namespace>.*` if it is exploratory or
   non-portable.
2. If multiple styles need it, it graduates to a typed schema addition
   (`Option<T>` field, new attribute-enum variant).
3. The schema addition lands as a `minor` bump. Older engines see it as
   `SoftDegrade`. Newer engines honor it.
4. Stable promoted features may eventually become required — that
   transition is the `major` bump and is governed by the deprecation
   policy in [`ENUM_VOCABULARY_POLICY.md`](../policies/ENUM_VOCABULARY_POLICY.md).

## Acceptance checks

This spec is `Active` once the snapshot in
`crates/citum-engine/tests/snapshots/forward_compat_gaps.snap` shows
`declared == observed` for every row whose desired class is `Pass` or
`SoftDegrade`. Rows whose desired class is `HardFail` are already
aligned and do not block promotion.

## Worked scenarios

### A new contributor role ships in v0.52

A style needs `producer` for a film-credits template:

```yaml
bibliography:
  template:
    - contributor: producer
      form: long
```

Engine 0.51 reads this style. Today: serde rejects the unknown variant
with a parse error, the user sees "unknown variant `producer`". Under
this spec: `SoftDegrade` — the template component renders as empty
(no producer field on the data), and a `CompatibilityWarning` is
emitted naming `contributor: producer` and the schema version that
introduced it.

### A style adds a new top-level section

A style ships an `experiments` block:

```yaml
version: "0.52"
experiments:
  inline-author-disambiguation: true
bibliography: ...
```

Engine 0.51 reads this. Today: `Style` has `deny_unknown_fields`,
parse fails. Under this spec: `SoftDegrade` — the `experiments` block
is captured into an opaque `unknown_sections` map (or similar), a
warning is emitted, and the rest of the style renders normally.

### A reference adds a new field

```yaml
- id: smith2026
  class: monograph
  title: ...
  audience: scholarly
```

Engine 0.51 reads this. Today: `Monograph` cannot deny unknown fields
(serde+`#[serde(tag)]` limitation), so the `audience` key is silently
discarded with no warning. Under this spec: the silent drop becomes a
`SoftDegrade` warning so users know data was not honored. Rendering is
otherwise unchanged.

### A reference uses a brand-new class

```yaml
- id: perf2026
  class: dance-performance
  title: ...
```

Today: parse fails. Pre-1.0 stance: the producer must introduce
`dance-performance` as a `major` bump; older engines may hard-fail.
Post-1.0 we may revisit this with a catch-all variant — see
[§ InputReference discriminator](#inputreference-discriminator).

## Non-goals

- Defining the exact Rust shape of `CompatibilityWarning`.
- Specifying which `style.version` value corresponds to which feature
  (the schema changelog already records that).
- Adding any tolerant deserializer code in this spec's PR.
- Changing the contract for `backward` compatibility (new engine, old
  data) — that path is already handled by `Option<T>` + `#[serde(default)]`.
