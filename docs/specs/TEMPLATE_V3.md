# Template Schema v3 Specification

**Status:** Active
**Version:** 0.5
**Date:** 2026-06-24
**Supersedes:** `docs/specs/TEMPLATE_V2.md`
**Related:** csl26-t3v1, `docs/specs/DISTRIBUTED_RESOLVER.md`

## Purpose

**Audience:** Engine implementers and style authors.

The "hard-fork" nature of V2's `type-variants` (complete replacement with no inheritance) is incompatible with a distributed style ecosystem. V3 reintroduces **Structural Template Inheritance** using a pure diff-based model, so that every type-variant can be deterministically derived from the base template at resolution time.

This design explicitly **rejects "Macros"** to avoid the complexity and fragmentation of CSL 1.0. Instead, it relies on two pillars:
1.  **Surgical Diffs:** Type-variants that modify, add, or remove components from a base template.
2.  **Logic-Heavy Options:** Moving shared formatting logic (contributor lists, date fallbacks) into style-level configuration rather than template structures.

## Scope

**In Scope:**
- `extends` keyword within `type-variants` (defaulting to the base `template`).
- List-diff operations: `modify`, `add`, `remove`.
- `message:` template components for locale-authored phrase realization.
- Expansion of `options` (e.g., `contributor-config`, `date-config`) to absorb shared logic.
- Impact on `DistributedResolver` style-merging.

**Out of Scope:**
- Named templates or Macros (Forbidden).
- Cross-section references to named reusable template fragments (Forbidden).
- YAML Anchors (MAY be used locally for authoring convenience but MUST NOT be relied upon for cross-style reuse).

Family roots MAY share a complete citation or bibliography section through
style inheritance. When a family head changes ordering-sensitive structure,
the head replaces that section explicitly. Some component sequences may
therefore repeat across heads; that duplication is preferred to reintroducing
CSL-like macro calls and does not by itself identify a schema gap.

## Terminology

- **Template:** An ordered list of components.
- **Component:** A single rendering instruction (e.g., `contributor: author`, `date: issued`, alongside rendering hints like `prefix` or `form`).
- **Type-variant:** A named diff that transforms the base template into a specialized template for a specific reference type (e.g., `article-journal`).

## Design

### §1 — The Structural Diff Model

In V3, every `type-variant` is a transformation of a parent template. By recording the **intent of the change** rather than a copy of the result, we ensure that updates to the parent style flow through to the variant.

```yaml
bibliography:
  template:
    - contributor: author
    - date: issued
      form: year
    - title: primary
    - variable: publisher
    - variable: url

  type-variants:
    article-journal:
      # If `extends` is omitted, the variant implicitly extends the base `template`.
      modify:
        - match: { variable: publisher }
          suppress: true
      add:
        - after: { title: primary }
          component: { title: parent-serial, emph: true }
```

If `extends` is omitted, the variant implicitly extends the base `template`. Optionally, `extends` MAY reference another type-variant of the same template, in which case the parent variant's diffs are applied before the child's.

### §2 — Absorbing Macros into Style Options

The primary reason authors use macros in other systems is to ensure consistent formatting for complex entities (like a list of 10 authors). Citum solves this by moving that logic into `options`.

#### 2.1 Contributor Configuration
Instead of a "Macro" for author formatting, authors configure the `contributor-config` once. Rendering of any component with `contributor: <role>` MUST be governed by `options.contributors.<role>` unless that component explicitly overrides one of these policies with a local hint (e.g., a local `delimiter`).

```yaml
options:
  contributors:
    author:
      shorten: { min: 3, use-first: 1 }
      and: "symbol"
      delimiter: ", "
      et-al-use-last: true
```

#### 2.2 Date Configuration
Templates SHOULD reference logical date roles (e.g., `date: issued`) while
`options.dates` centralizes their formatting policy. A date component MAY use
`fallback` to define its missing-value behavior. An absent fallback preserves
the engine default (`issued` uses the locale no-date term); an explicit fallback
list is authoritative. If every fallback component is empty, including when the
list itself is empty, the date is omitted.

```yaml
- date: issued
  form: year
  fallback: [] # Omit when issued is unavailable.
```

CSL and CSL-M date elements render nothing when their variable is unavailable.
Migration therefore emits an explicit empty fallback for `issued` dates unless
the source style supplies another fallback, such as a localized no-date term.

```yaml
- date: issued
  form: year
  fallback:
- message: term.no-date
```

### §2.3 MF2 Message Components

Templates MAY call an MF2 phrase with `message:`. Message bodies normally come
from the active locale, but a style MAY define specialized messages in
`options.messages`. A style-owned message takes precedence over a locale
message with the same ID, and inherited message maps merge by ID. This lets a
hidden family root own standard-specific textual classifications without
putting them into every locale.

```yaml
- message: pattern.accessed-date
  args:
    date: { date: accessed, form: day-month-abbr-year }

- message: pattern.in-container
  args:
    container: { title: parent-monograph, emph: true }
  text-case: capitalize-first

options:
  messages:
    standard.type-code: |-
      .match {$type :select} {$carrier :select}
      when book - {M}
      when book * {M/{$carrier}}
      when * * {Z}

bibliography:
  template:
    - message: standard.type-code
      args:
        type: { reference-type: key }
        carrier: { carrier: { online: OL, absent: '-' } }
```

Each `args` entry is rendered through the normal component pipeline before MF2
evaluation. Supported argument sources are `literal`, `variable`, `date`,
`title`, `contributor`, `number`, `term`, `group`, `reference-type`, and
`carrier`. `reference-type: key` supplies the canonical Citum reference-type
key. `carrier` supplies the reference's explicit medium when present, otherwise
the configured `online` value for URL, DOI, or CSTR resources, and the
configured `absent` value for offline resources. The resulting strings become
MF2 named variables (`{$date}`, `{$container}`, etc.).

Style-owned messages are a textual-realization and classification mechanism.
They MUST NOT be used to recreate general template control flow, and this spec
does not add a generic literal template component or CSL-style conditional
language. Structural selection remains in typed templates and type variants.

The style owns phrase and argument selection; the locale normally owns word
order and glue text. `term:` components remain readable for compatibility, but
new localized phrase work SHOULD use `message:` and `pattern.*` locale IDs.
`term.*` and `role.*` message IDs remain valid for lexical labels,
abbreviations, and inflected role forms; role-plus-name phrases can move to
`pattern.*` when the locale needs to control placement around rendered names.

### §3 — Merge Operations (Formalized)

The engine MUST process each operation list (`modify`, `remove`, `add`) in the order provided. The order of these keys (`modify`, `remove`, `add`) within a variant has no semantic effect.

1.  **Identify Anchor (Match):** A `match` selector is a partial match: a component matches if it contains all key-value pairs specified in `match`, with equal values, regardless of any additional keys on the component.
    *   If no component matches, the operation MUST be ignored or treated as a validation error (implementation-defined, but validators SHOULD treat this as an error).
    *   If multiple components match, engines MUST treat this as a validation error or select the first match deterministically; style authors SHOULD avoid ambiguous `match` selectors.
2.  **Apply Operation:**
    *   `modify`: Overwrites rendering hints. If a `modify` operation attempts to change the component’s kind or primary value (e.g., `contributor: author` to `contributor: editor` or `variable: publisher` to `variable: url`), the style is invalid and must be rejected by validators or ignored by non-validating engines (implementation-defined).
    *   `remove`: Deletes the anchor from the list.
    *   `add`: Inserts a new component `before` or `after` the anchor. An `add` operation MAY specify either `before` or `after`, but not both. If both are present, the style is invalid. If the anchor in `before`/`after` does not match any component, the engine MUST append the new component to the end of the list.

### §4 — Distributed Merging

Resolution (`try_into_resolved_with`) follows the URI chain. Resolution is recursive: if the parent style itself `extends` another style, the engine MUST fully resolve that ancestor chain before applying the child’s diffs.

When a child style `extends` a remote parent:
1.  Fetches and fully resolves the remote parent's templates.
2.  Applies the parent's `type-variants` (if any).
3.  Applies the child's `type-variants` diffs to the fully resolved parent template.

**Example: Subscriber Style (`university-apa.yaml`)**
```yaml
extends: https://hub.citum.org/styles/apa.yaml

bibliography:
  # No local 'template:' is defined; it is inherited from the parent.
  type-variants:
    article-journal:
      # Inherits the article-journal from APA, then adds a localized label:
      add:
        - before: { variable: doi }
          component: { term: doi, suffix: ": " }
```

Engines SHOULD treat unreachable or invalid parent URIs as resolution errors; style authors MUST NOT assume offline resolution if remote parents are unavailable.
