# `render-when` Disposition: Freeze, Add `group: select: first`, Defer Work-Form Routing

- **Date:** 2026-09-06
- **Question:** An embedded-style parity pass wanted three new `render-when`
  condition fields (`url`, `pages`, `publisher-place`) to fix 54 embedded
  rows. That conflicts with a standing project position — `csl26-7652`
  already rejected a locator-kind condition field on the grounds that it
  "relocates CSL's procedural `<choose>` branching into the Citum template
  layer, which this project has deliberately kept declarative." Given that,
  what should happen to `render-when` itself: extend it anyway, remove it, or
  something else — and what unblocks the parity work that motivated the
  question?

## Two examples that look identical and aren't

**Chicago's multivolume title** (`chicago-author-date-18th.yaml:416-425`):

```yaml
- group:
  - variable: volume-title
    emph: true
  render-when:
    field-present: volume-title
    field-absent: part-number-non-numeric
- group:
  - title: primary
  render-when:
    field-absent: volume-title
```

Read as a sentence: *a multivolume work is titled by its own volume title;
failing that, by the work's title.* The field being tested, `volume-title`,
is the same field the branch renders. This is a fallback — try one thing,
then another — wearing a conditional's syntax.

**Chicago's editor form for numbered volumes** (`chicago-author-date-18th.yaml:457-470`):

```yaml
- group:
  - contributor: editor
    form: verb
    name-order: given-first
  - title: parent-monograph
    emph: true
  render-when:
    field-absent: volume-or-issue
- group:
  - contributor: editor
    form: verb
    name-order: given-first
  render-when:
    field-present: volume-or-issue
```

Read as a sentence: *a serial-numbered container renders its editor
differently from an unnumbered one.* `volume-or-issue` never appears in
either branch's rendered content — it is a switch on one property of the
reference that reroutes rendering of an unrelated one. This is a structural
policy decision, and no fallback list can express it: there's nothing to fall
back *from*.

Both blocks use the identical `render-when` primitive. They are not the same
kind of thing, and that distinction is the whole finding.

## What the inventory shows

`render-when` appears 125 times across the embedded style corpus: 123 in
Chicago (`chicago-author-date-18th` 48, `chicago-notes-18th` 34,
`chicago-shortened-notes-bibliography-core` 29,
`taylor-and-francis-chicago-author-date-core` 12), 2 in
`gb-t-7714-2025-base`, and **zero in the exemplar tier** —
`citum-migrate` does not emit this feature (`RENDER_WHEN_CONTRACT.md` states
this as a scope decision, not an omission).

Every use was classified by one test: does the field the condition tests
appear as a rendered component inside the branch it guards?

| Shape | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Fallback** — tested field renders inside its own `field-present` branch | 49 | try this, then that |
| **Policy gate** — tested field does not render inside its `field-present` branch | 25 | structural policy decision |
| **Else-branch** — `field-absent`-only branch, pairing with a fallback or a policy gate | 50 | the "else" of one of the above |
| **Compound** — two fields tested together | 1 | (`part-number` present, `volume-title` absent) |

The decisive number: grouping by field rather than by use, the six
highest-volume fields — `volume-title` (31 uses), `volume-or-issue` (24),
`part-number-non-numeric` (16), `genre` (16), `title` (12),
`part-number-numeric` (9) — **108 of the 125 uses** — are each a *mix* of
fallback and policy-gate shapes. `genre`, for instance, guards a
genre-then-episode-number fallback in one place and an unrelated title/date
arrangement in another. No field can be retired by one replacement; "swap
`render-when` for a single better primitive" is not an option this data
supports.

## Recommendation: freeze the vocabulary, add one new primitive, defer the rest

Extending `render-when` is rejected on the same grounds as `csl26-7652`: it
adds more procedural test-then-branch surface to the template layer, which
DESIGN_PRINCIPLES §4 states plainly ("templates replace procedural
conditionals... generic spines first"). The three fields the parity pass
wanted (`url`, `pages`, `publisher-place`) would all have been used to build
fallback-shaped conditions — exactly the case that has a declarative answer
already.

Removing `render-when` outright is rejected for now: the 25 policy-gate uses
have no declarative replacement today, and inventing one is a real design
problem (see below), not a mechanical migration.

The recommended path splits the two shapes and ships only the one that's
ready.

### `group: select: first` — an ordered candidate list (ready to spec)

The fallback shapes are all instances of one existing pattern in the
codebase, generalized: an ordered list of candidate renderings, first
non-empty one wins, no predicate over source data at all. Three
domain-specific versions
of exactly this already exist and are accepted project idiom:

- `Substitute.candidates: [editor, translator]` with
  `otherwise: {message: term.anonymous}` (`options/substitute.rs:101`)
- `DateFallbackCandidate::{Date, Message, Variable}` (`options/date_fallback.rs:22`)
- `ArticleJournalNoPageFallback::Doi` (`options/bibliography.rs:136`) — whose
  own spec text concedes it is "a small external bibliography parameter,"
  narrower than the general case

A `select: first` group is the general primitive those three keep
independently reinventing. It's declarative in the sense the project cares
about: it names an ordered set of *things to try*, not a *test to
evaluate*.

One correction to avoid overclaiming in the spec: `Substitute` carries
role-slot semantics — a substituted editor inherits the author's name
formatting, label, and sort position — that a bare candidate list doesn't
have. `select: first` is the shape underneath all three, not a drop-in
replacement for `Substitute` itself.

**This also fixes an open, unrelated bug by construction.** `csl26-x79y`
found that `render-when: field-present: author` reads the raw author field,
so it silently misfires on any reference where an editor has been
role-substituted into the author slot — `RENDER_WHEN_CONTRACT.md` states as
policy that conditions "do not inspect substitution results." A `select:
first` group tests *output*, not raw presence, so it has no equivalent
blind spot.

Group suppression in the engine is already CSL-correct — `values/list.rs:70`
treats a `group:` as empty when it produced no non-term content, so a
branch like `[message: pattern.chicago-of, number: part-number]` already
goes empty on its own when `part-number` is absent. That rule lives entirely
inside `TemplateGroup::values` and has no bearing on render-when,
variable-once tracking, or substitution bookkeeping — those live on
`Renderer` (`crates/citum-engine/src/processor/rendering/mod.rs` and
`grouped/core.rs`), a different layer. `select: first` needs no *new* "did
this render" concept, but it does need to be implemented against the right
existing one: `Renderer`'s per-component dispatch, not `values::list.rs` in
isolation — see `docs/specs/GROUP_SELECT.md`'s Implementation Notes.

It also directly answers one of the parity pass's three needs — `[place
unknown]` (7 rows): a `select: first` group over `{variable:
publisher-place}` and `{message: term.place-unknown}`. The other two do
**not** route through `select: first`: the `[Internet]` marker is a
marker, not a fallback (see the companion `docs/specs/MEDIUM_DESIGNATOR.md`),
and NLM's DOI-when-no-page-or-volume rule turned out, on closer reading of
the shipped CSL, to be a type- and field-presence-gated choice, not an
output-based fallback — it extends the existing
`ArticleJournalNoPageFallback` option directly (`csl26-8z39`), not
`select: first`. Generalizing `ArticleJournalNoPageFallback` into a
`select: first` group does not work for this case: NLM's actual `access`
macro's normal detail block includes `date: issued`, present on nearly
every reference, so an output-based fallback would never fall through to
DOI. See `docs/specs/GROUP_SELECT.md`'s "Relationship to existing
mechanisms" section for the full trace.

And it opens a migration path `RENDER_WHEN_CONTRACT.md` explicitly closed:
that spec refuses to let `citum-migrate` emit `render-when` at all. A CSL
`<choose><if variable="X">…<else>…` where `X` appears in the `if` branch is
exactly fallback-shaped, and `select: first` can accept it as a migration
target where `render-when` never could.

### Work-form routing — no design exists yet

The 25 policy-gate shapes are one coherent domain idea with no name yet in
the schema: whether a reference is a numbered volume, a titled volume, a
named part, or an unnumbered whole changes how several unrelated fields
(editor form, container title, page prefix) are arranged. That's squarely
`csl26-x61x` ("Chicago: volume, issue, and series grammar," open, high
priority) territory, and `docs/specs/INPUT_REFERENCE_CLASS_DISCRIMINATOR.md`
is the existing home for this class of distinction — but no design exists
yet for this specific case.

This is the actual blocker on removing `render-when`: until work-form routing
has a declarative shape, the 25 policy-gate uses have nowhere to go.

## Recommended sequencing

1. Freeze the `render-when` field vocabulary now (`RENDER_WHEN_CONTRACT.md`
   v1.2) — existing 125 uses keep working, no new fields are added.
2. Spec and land `group: select: first`.
3. Design work-form routing under `csl26-40n4`, using the policy-gate
   inventory above as the forcing-case set.
4. Migrate Chicago's 123 uses to the two new primitives per-style, then
   deprecate `render-when`.

Step 4 is explicitly **not** part of this decision's follow-on work: eight
Chicago beans are in-progress right now (`csl26-0u0f`, `adka`, `ax22`,
`j1wp`, `jxco`, `rrsb`, `s2kt`, `wtaq`), and rewriting the substrate under
them would collide with all of it. That migration belongs to `csl26-40n4`
once step 3 has a design.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Extend `render-when`'s field vocabulary** (the trigger for this
  question). Rejected: repeats the exact objection `csl26-7652` already
  raised for a different field; every field the parity pass needed was
  fallback-shaped and has a cleaner declarative answer.
- **Remove `render-when` immediately, migrate everything now.** Rejected: no
  design exists for the 25 policy-gate uses; forcing a migration without one
  would mean inventing ad hoc per-style workarounds, which is worse than the
  status quo.
- **Leave `render-when` open for future extension.** Rejected: extension
  criteria in `RENDER_WHEN_CONTRACT.md` already gate on "not a stand-in for a
  distinction an option, preset, or type-variant should own instead" — every
  field this session evaluated failed that test. Freezing makes that
  judgment explicit instead of re-litigating it per proposal.

## Follow-on beans

- `csl26-zmxt` (under `csl26-40n4`): design work-form routing for the
  policy-gate inventory above (volume-or-issue / part-number-numeric /
  part-number-non-numeric editor and container routing).
- `csl26-x79y`: cross-linked — resolved by construction once `select:
  first` ships and Chicago's author-substitution gates migrate to it.
- `csl26-x61x`: cross-linked as the eventual home for work-form routing.
- `csl26-zs9y`: root cause reclassified from "needs a render-when field" to
  "needs `select: first`" for the `[place unknown]` case, "needs a medium
  designator option" (see `docs/specs/MEDIUM_DESIGNATOR.md`) for the
  `[Internet]` case, and "extend `ArticleJournalNoPageFallback`"
  (`csl26-8z39`) for the NLM-DOI case — see the Recommendation section above
  for why the NLM-DOI case doesn't fit `select: first`.
- `csl26-2hr4`: a pre-existing tracker-merge-before-empty-check quirk in
  plain `group:` rendering, found while specifying `select: first`'s
  tracker semantics. Unrelated to `render-when`'s disposition; filed under
  the engine-review epic.
- `csl26-8z39`: extends `ArticleJournalNoPageFallback` (not `select:
  first`) to cover NLM/CSE's DOI-if-no-page-or-volume rule.
